The goal of quarto-manuscript is to create a GitHub template for writing a collaborative, reproducible manuscript using Quarto.

### Things I want it to do:

- [ ] Use GitHub actions + GitHub pages to render and deploy an HTML version of the manuscript

- [ ] Integrate hypothes.is for commenting on HTML version

- [ ] Render a .docx version with author affiliations and corresponding author info formatted legibly for submission to a journal

- [ ] Do cross references to figures, tables, equations, (and other arbitrary sections like boxes?) that are inserted with markdown or generated from code chunks.

- [ ] Line numbers

- [ ] Enforce sentence wrap for .qmd documents for nice version control
